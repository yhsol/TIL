# Common Collections

Rust's standard library
includes a number of very userful
data structures called _collections_.
Most other data types
represent one specific value,
but collections can contain multiple values.
Unlike the built-in array and tuple types,
the data these collections point
to is stored on the heap,
which means the amount of data does
not need to be known
at compile time
and can grow
or shrink as the program runs.
Each kind of collection has different capabilities
and costs,
and choosing an appropriate one
for your current situtation is a skill
you'll develop over tiem.
In this chapter,
we'll discuss three collections that are
used very often in Rust progarms:

- a _vector_ allows you to store a variable number of value next to each other.
- A _string_ is a collection of characters.
  We've mentioned the `String` type previously,
  but in this chpater we'll talk about it in depth.
- A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value
  with a particular key.
  It's particular implementation of the more general data structure called a _map_.

To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library,
see the documentation.

We'll discuss how to create and update vectors,
strings, and hash maps, as well as what makes each special.
