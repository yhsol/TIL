# Concise Control Flow with `if let`

The `if let` syntax lets you
combine `if` and `let`
into a less verbose way
to handle values that match one pattern
while ignoring the rest.
Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an
`Option<u8>` value but
only wants to execute code if the value is 3.

```rs
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
match some_u8_value {
    Some(3) => println!("three"),
    _ => ().
}
```

Listing 6-6: A `match` that only cares about executing code when the value is `Some(3)`

We want to do something
with the `Some(3)` match
but do nothing with any other `Some<u8>` value
or the `None` value.
To satisfy the `match` expression,
we have to add `_ => ()` after processing just one variant, which is a lot of boilerplate code to add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`.
The following code behaves the same as the `match` in Listing 6-6:

```rs
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
    println("three");
}
```

The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression
separated by an equal sign.
It works the same way as a `match`,
where the expression is given
to the `match` and the pattern is its first arm.
