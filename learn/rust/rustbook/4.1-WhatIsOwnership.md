# What Is Ownership?

Rust's central feature is _ownership_.
Alothough the feature is straightforward to explain,
it has deep implications for the rest of the language.

All programs have to manage the way they use a computer's memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that cnostantly looks for no longer used memory as the program runs;
in other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory.
Rust uses a thrid approach:
memory is managed though a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.
None of the onwership features slow down your programs while it's running.

Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers.
it does take some time to get used to.
The good news is that the more expreienced you become with Rust and the rules of the ownership system,
the more you'll be able to naturally develop code that is safe and efficient.
Keep at it!
