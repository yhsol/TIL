# Control Flow

Deciding whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true and deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true are basic building blocks in most programming languages.
The most common constructs
that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and loops.

## `if` Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch you code depending on conditions.
You provide a condition and then state,
"If this condition is met,
run this block of code.
If the condition is not met,
do not run this block of code."

Create a new project called `branches` in you _projects_ directory
to explore the `if` expression.
In the _src/main.rs_ file,
input the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rs
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

All `if` expressions start with the keyword `if`,
which is followed by a condition.
In this case,
the condition checks whether or not the variable `number` has a value
less that 5.
The block of code we want to execute
if the condition is true is placed immediately after the condition inside curly brackets.
Blocks of code associated with the conditions
is `if` expressions are sometimes called _arms_,
just like the arms in `match` expressions
that we discussed in the "Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number"
section of Chapter 2.

Optionally,
we can also include an `else` expression,
which we chose to do here,
to give the program an alternative block of code to execute
should the condition evaluate to false.
If you don't provide an `else` expression
and the condition is false,
the program will just skip the `if` block and move on to the next bit of code.

Try running this code;
you should see the following output:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true
```

Let's try changing the value of `number` to a value that makes the condition `false` to see what happens:

```rs
    let number = 7;
```

Run the program again, and look at the output:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false
```

It's also worth noting that the condition in this code
_must_ be a `bool`.
If the condition ins't a `bool`,
we'll get an error.
For example,
try running the following code:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rs
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

The `if` condition evaluates to a value of `3` this time,
and Rust throws an error:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:8
  |
4 |     if number {
  |        ^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found integer

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `branches`

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
```

The error indicates that Rust expected a `bool` but got an integer.
Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript,
Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types
to a Boolean.
You must be explicit and always provide `if` with a Boolean
as its condition.
If we want the `if` code block
to run only when a number is not equal to `0`,
for example,
we can change the `if` expression to the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rs
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
}
```

Rurnning this code will print `number was something other than zero`.
