# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the duplication of concepts.
In Rust, one such tool is _generics_. Generics are abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties. When we're writing code, we can express the behavior of generics or how they relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place when compiling and running the code.

Similar to the way a function takes parameters with unknown values to run the same code on multiple concrete values, functions can take parameters
of some generic type instead of a concrete type, like `i32` or `String`.
In fact, we've already used generics in Chapter 6 with `Option<T>`,
Chapter 8 with `Vec<T>` and `HashMap<K, V>`, and Chapter 9 with `Result<T, E>`.
In this chapter, you'll explore how to define your own types,
functions, and methods with generics!

First, we'll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication.
Next, we'll use the same technique to make a generic function from two functions that differ only in the types of their parameters.
We'll also explain how to use generics types in struct and enum definitions.

Then you'll learn how to use _traits_ to define
behavior in a generic way.
You can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to only those types that have a particular behavior,
as opposed to just any type.

Finally, we'll discuss _lifetimes_,
a variety of generics that give the compiler information about
fow references relate to each other.
Lifetimes allow us to borrow values in many situations while still enabling the compiler to check that the references are valid.
