# Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

A _trait_ tells the Rust compiler
about functionality a particular type has and can share with other types.
We can use tratis to define shared in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.

```
Note: Traits are similar to a feature ofthen called _interfaces_ in other languages, although with some differences.
```
