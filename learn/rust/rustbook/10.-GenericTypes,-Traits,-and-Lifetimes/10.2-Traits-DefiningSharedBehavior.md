# Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

A _trait_ tells the Rust compiler
about functionality a particular type has and can share with other types.
We can use tratis to define shared in an abstract way. We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.

```
Note: Traits are similar to a feature ofthen called _interfaces_ in other languages, although with some differences.
```

## Defining a Trait

A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type.
Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types.
Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behavior necessary to accomplish some purpose.

For example, let's say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and amounts of text:
a `NewsArticle` struct that holds a news story field in a particular location and a `Tweet` that can have at most 280 characters along with metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply to another tweet.

We want to make a media aggregator library that can display summaries of data that might be stored in a `NewsArticle` or `Tweet` instance.
To do this, we need a summary from each type,
and we need to request that summary by calling a `summarize` method on an instance.
Listing 10-12 shows the definition of a `Summary` trait that expresses this behavior.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rs
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}
```

Listing 10-12: A `Summary` trait that consists of the behavior provided by a `summarize` method

Here, we declare a trait using the `trait` keyword and then the trait's name, which is `Summary` in this case. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures that describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in this case is `fn summarize(&self) -> String`.

After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly brackets, we use a semicolon.
Each type implementing this trait must provide its own custom behavior for the body of the method.
The compiler will enforce that any type that has the `Summary` trait will have the method `summarize` defined with this signature exactly.

A trait can have multiple methods in its body:
the method signatures are listed one per line and each line ends in a semicolon.
