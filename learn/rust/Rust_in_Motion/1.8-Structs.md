# 1.8 Structs

- Structs, short for _structures_, are custome types that group related data together,
  such as all of the attributes of a hockey player.

### When structs are useful

- Remember the `HockeyPosition` enum we created in the previous module?
  Let's say we now want to create a data type that models a hockey player - that would be a good fit for a struct.

- An enum is for when you want to describe a choice between a set of values, such as choosing banana, apple, or orange from a set of fruits.

- A struct is when you want to have the same attributes for all of the values of that type,
  such as multiple recipes that all have a list of ingredients and a list of directions.

### define and using a hockey player struct in code

```rs
enum HockeyPosition {
    Wing
}

struct HockeyPlayer {
    name: String,
    number: u8,
    position: HockeyPosition,
    goals_ytd: u8,
}

fn main() {
    let player = HockeyPlayer {
        name: String::from("Bryan Rust")
        number: 17,
        position: HockeyPosition::Wing,
        goals_ytd: 7,
    };

    // and make it mutable
    let mut mutable_player = HockeyPlayer {
        name: String::from("Bryan Rust Mutable")
        number: 17,
        position: HockeyPosition::Wing,
        goals_ytd: 7,
    };

    mutable_player.goals_ytd += 1;

    println!(
        "{} has scored {} goals this season",
        player.name,
        palyer.goals_ytd,
    );
}
```

## Tuple structs

```rs
Struct Triangle(u32, u32, u32);

fn main() {
    let triangle1 = Triangle(3, 4, 5);
}
```
