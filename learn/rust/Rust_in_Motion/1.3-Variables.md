# 1.3 Variables

```rs
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
}
```

- declaration start with the let keyword
- declaring a variable name `a`
- Using an equal sign, assign the value to the variable
- Semicolons separates Rust statement

- the `main` function is the entry point to binary programs
- It's the function gets called when excute `cargo run`

- `println!` macro is print in Rust
- The first argument is the format string and the curly braces in that format string are placeholders for the values wnat to print out, which are specified as the rest of the arguments

- mutability

  - Rust variables is immutable by default

  ```rs
      fn main() {
          let x = 5;
          x += 1;
          println!("x is now {}", x);
      }

      // compiler error
  ```

  - it's cause the compiler error because cannot assign twice to the immutable variable, `x`

  - make a variable mutable

    - using `mut` keyword
    - `let mut x =`

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        x += 1;
        println!("x is now {}", x);
    }

    // print x is 6
    ```

- type

  - every variable in Rust has a type
  - based on the values they contain

  ```rs
      fn main() {
          let dog: Dog = 'dog';
          let cat: Cat = 'cat';
          let mut x: i32 = 5;
      }
  ```

  - In previous examples, didn't have to say that `x` was an `i32`, though.
    - Rust was able to figure that out based on the value, `5`, that assigned to it
    - If you'd like to annotate your types as yor're learning, feel free.
  - If annotate types doesn't match to values, compiler error tells us that!

  ```rs
      fn main() {
          let x: i32 = true;
      }

      // compiler error
      // x is 'bool' type
  ```
